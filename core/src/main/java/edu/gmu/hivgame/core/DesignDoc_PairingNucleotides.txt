Design doc for getting nucleotides to pair into double strands

- Nucleotide x collision with another nucleotide y:
- Nucleotide.handleCollison() (from interface CollisionHandler)
- x is in already in a DNAStrand and is responsible for grabbing y if
  it is a free Nucleotide
- y will do nothing
- x Checks if y is free
- x checks if x is in a strand
- x checks if x is unpaired
- Invoke DNAStrand.alert(x,y) for x's DNAStrand called S
- In S.alert(x,y) double-check assumptions
- S checks if it is in a DoubleHelix D and invokes D.alert(x,y)
- D double-checks assumptions
- D invokes x.basePair(y) which creates the physical connection
(probably rope joints)
- D checks for Nucleotides x and y matching, maintains count of
  matched/mismatched Nucleotides
- D adds y to the end of D.strandB; D.strandA is always the complete
  strand with the active Nucleotide while D.strandB grows; creates
  physical connection to another Nucleotide in strandB
- D invokes evalUNA() to update which is the unpaired nucleotide in
  D.strandA
